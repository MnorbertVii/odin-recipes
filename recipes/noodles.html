	<h2>Description about the recipe</h2>
	<p>noodle, a cooked egg-and-flour paste prominent in European and Asian cuisine,<br>
	   generally distinguished from pasta by its elongated ribbon like form. Noodles<br>
	   are commonly used to add body and flavour to broth soups. They are commonly<br>
	   boiled or saut√©ed and served with sauces and meats or baked in casseroles.</p>
	   <h2>Ingredients.</h2>
	   <ul>
		<li>1/3 cup red miso paste</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
		<li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
		<li>1 medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
		<li>3 clove cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
		<li>2/3 cups water</li>
	   </ul>
	   <h2>Directions.</h2>

		<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Combine red miso paste, maple syrup, rice vinegar, soy sauce,<br>
			garlic powder, black pepper, kosher salt, and sriracha in a <br>
			mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.</li>
		<li>Add beef to the bowl and coat thoroughly on both sides, poking beef all over<br>
			with a fork to allow the marinade to soak into the meat.</li>
